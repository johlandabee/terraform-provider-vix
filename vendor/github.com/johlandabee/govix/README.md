The VIX API allows you to automate virtual machine operations on most current VMware hosted products such as: vmware workstation, player, fusion and server.

vSphere API, starting from 5.0, merged VIX API in the so-called GuestOperationsManager managed object. So, we encourage you to use https://github.com/vmware/govmomi for vSphere instead.

## Features
This API supports:

* Adding, removing and listing virtual networks adapters attached to a VM
* Adding and removing virtual CPUs and memory from a VM
* Managing virtual machines life cycle: power on, power off, reset, pause and resume.
* Adding and removing shared folders
* Taking screenshots from a running VM
* Cloning VMs
* Creating and removing Snapshots as well as restoring a VM from a Snapshot
* Upgrading virtual hardware
* Guest management: login, logout, install vmware tools, etc.
* Attaching and detaching CD/DVD drives on SATA, SCSI or IDE controllers

For a more detailed information about the API, please refer to the API documentation.

## To keep in mind when running your apps

#### Dynamic library loading
In order for Go to find libvix when running your compiled binary, a govix path has to be added to the *LD_LIBRARY_PATH* environment variable. Example:

* **OSX:** `export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=${GOPATH}/src/github.com/hooklift/govix/vendor/libvix`
* **Linux:** `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${GOPATH}/src/github.com/hooklift/govix/vendor/libvix`
* **Windows:** append the path to the PATH environment variable

Be aware that the previous example assumes $GOPATH only has one path set.

## Debugging
### Enabling debug logs

`echo "vix.debugLevel = \"9\"" >> ~/Library/Preferences/VMware\ Fusion/config`


### Logs
* **OSX:** `~/Library/Logs/VMware/*.log`
* **Linux:** `/tmp/vmware-<username>/vix-<pid>.log`
* **Windows:** `%TEMP%\vmware-<username>\vix-<pid>.log`


### Multithreading

The Vix library is intended for use by multi-threaded clients. Vix shared
objects are managed by the Vix library to avoid conflicts between threads.
Clients need only be responsible for protecting user-defined shared data.
